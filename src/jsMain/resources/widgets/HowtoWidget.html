            You can view your courses <b>into your own calendar</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            You can add a <a href="" id="linkWebcal" target="_blank">calendar subscription</a>
            so changes to events will automatically show<br>
            <br>
            Do it on a desktop browser, on mobile it does not work and
            <a href="" id="linkMailto" target="_blank">send yourself an email</a> to access this on all your devices.
            <br>
            <br>

            For <b>Apple calendar</b> and maybe others, you should use this:<br>
            <div class="form-group">
                <input type="text" readonly id="httpxUrl" style="font-size:12px;" class="form-control">
            </div>
            <br>
            For more information on subscriptions see <a href="http://tiny.cc/what-is-webcal"
                                                         target="_blank">http://tiny.cc/what-is-webcal</a>.

            <br><br>
            In order to avoid losing access to this calendar you should send yourself an email with all the information

To add a subscription to your (Apple, Google, Microsoft) calendar:
